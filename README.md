# JavaScript Data Stuctures and Algorithm

### Introduction
This repository contains my notes on data structures, LeetCode problems, and their corresponding solutions. It serves as a resource for learning and practicing JavaScript algorithms and data structures.

### Data Structures
1. Stack
2. Quene
3. *_Linked List_*
4. Set
5. Map
6. *_Tree_*
7. Graph
8. Heap

### Algorithms
* The traverse of linked list, tree and graph
* The sort and search of array

### Algorithm Design
* *_Divide-and-Conquer Algorithm_*
* *_Dynamic Programming_*
* Greedy Algorithm
* Backtracking Algorithm
