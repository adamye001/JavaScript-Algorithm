# JavaScript Data Stuctures and Algorithms

### Introduction
This repository contains my notes on data structures, LeetCode problems, and their corresponding solutions. It serves as a resource for learning and practicing JavaScript algorithms and data structures.

### Data Structures
1. Stack
2. Quene
3. ***Linked List***
4. Set
5. Map
6. ***Tree***
7. Graph
8. Heap

### Algorithms
* The traverse of linked list, tree and graph
* The sort and search of array

### Algorithm Design
* ***Divide-and-Conquer Algorithm***
* ***Dynamic Programming***
* Greedy Algorithm
* Backtracking Algorithm
